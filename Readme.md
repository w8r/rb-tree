# [WIP] Red-Black tree [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/rb-tree.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/rb-tree) [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/w8r/rb-tree.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/w8r/rb-tree)

[RB-tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-black_tree): **[fast](#benchmarks)**(non-recursive) and **simple**(< 500 lines of code)
Implementation is adapted directly from Wikipedia with the same API as [w8r/avl](https://github.com/w8r/avl), to run the benchmarks agains other trees.

## Install

```shell
npm i -S rb-tree
```

```js
import RBTree from 'rb-tree';
const tree = new RBTree();
```

Or get it from CDN
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/splaytree"></script>
<script>
  var tree = new RBTree();
  ...
</script>
```
Or use the compiled version 'dist/splay.js'.

## API

* `new RBTree([comparator], [noDuplicates:Boolean])`, where `comparator` is optional comparison function
* `tree.insert(key:any, [data:any]):Node` - Insert item
* `tree.remove(key:any):Boolean` - Remove item
* `tree.removeNode(Node:any)|Boolean` - Remove node
* `tree.find(key):Node|Null` - Return node by its key
* `tree.at(index:Number):Node|Null` - Return node by its index in sorted order of keys
* `tree.contains(key):Boolean` - Whether a node with the given key is in the tree
* `tree.forEach(function(node) {...}):Tree` In-order traversal
* `tree.keys():Array<key>` - Returns the array of keys in order
* `tree.values():Array<*>` - Returns the array of data fields in order
* `tree.range(lo, high, function(node) {} [, context]):Tree` - Walks the range of keys in order. Stops, if the visitor function returns a non-zero value.
* `tree.pop():Node` - Removes smallest node
* `tree.min():key` - Returns min key
* `tree.max():key` - Returns max key
* `tree.minNode():Node` - Returns the node with smallest key
* `tree.maxNode():Node` - Returns the node with highest key
* `tree.prev(node):Node` - Predecessor node
* `tree.next(node):Node` - Successor node
* `tree.load(keys:Array<*>, [values:Array<*>][,presort=false]):Tree` - Bulk-load items. It expects values and keys to be sorted, but if `presort` is `true`, it will sort keys and values using the comparator(in-place!). You can only use it on an empty tree.
* `RBTree.createTree(keys:Array<Key>, [values:Array<Value>][,comparator][,presort:Boolean][,noDuplicates:Boolean]):RBTree` - creates and loads the tree. Equivalent of `new RBTree(comparator, noDuplicates).load(keys, values, presort)`.

**Comparator**

`function(a:key,b:key):Number` - Comparator function between two keys, it returns
 * `0` if the keys are equal
 * `<0` if `a < b`
 * `>0` if `a > b`

 The comparator function is extremely important, in case of errors you might end
 up with a wrongly constructed tree or would not be able to retrieve your items.
 It is crucial to test the return values of your `comparator(a,b)` and `comparator(b,a)`
 to make sure it's working correctly, otherwise you may have bugs that are very
 unpredictable and hard to catch.

 **Duplicate keys**

 By default, tree allows duplicate keys. You can disable that by passing `true`
 as a second parameter to the tree constructor. In that case if you would try to
 instert an item with the key, that is already present in the tree, it will not
 be inserted.
 However, the default behavior allows for duplicate keys, cause there are cases
 where you cannot predict that the keys would be unique (example: overlapping
 points in 2D).

## Example

```js
import Tree from 'splaytree';

const t = new Tree();
t.insert(5);
t.insert(-10);
t.insert(0);
t.insert(33);
t.insert(2);

console.log(t.keys()); // [-10, 0, 2, 5, 33]
console.log(t.size);   // 5
console.log(t.min());  // -10
console.log(t.max());  // -33

t.remove(0);
console.log(t.size);   // 4
```

**Custom comparator (reverse sort)**

```js
import Tree from 'splaytree';

const t = new Tree((a, b) => b - a);
t.insert(5);
t.insert(-10);
t.insert(0);
t.insert(33);
t.insert(2);

console.log(t.keys()); // [33, 5, 2, 0, -10]
```

**Bulk insert**

```js
import Tree from 'splaytree';

const t = new Tree();
t.load([3,2,-10,20], ['C', 'B', 'A', 'D']);
console.log(t.keys());   // [-10, 2, 3, 20]
console.log(t.values()); // ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
```

## Benchmarks

```shell
npm run benchmark
```

```
Insert (x1000)
Bintrees x 3,320 ops/sec ±4.69% (81 runs sampled)
Functional red black tree x 1,717 ops/sec ±7.36% (71 runs sampled)
Google Closure library AVL x 538 ops/sec ±7.55% (70 runs sampled)
RB (current) x 1,783 ops/sec ±6.07% (73 runs sampled)
AVL x 4,790 ops/sec ±4.38% (76 runs sampled)
- Fastest is AVL

Random read (x1000)

Functional red black tree x 12,263 ops/sec ±5.32% (77 runs sampled)
Google Closure library AVL x 19.12 ops/sec ±12.82% (39 runs sampled)
RB (current) x 14,897 ops/sec ±1.16% (85 runs sampled)
AVL x 14,381 ops/sec ±2.42% (88 runs sampled)
- Fastest is RB (current)

Remove (x1000)
Bintrees x 99,828 ops/sec ±2.22% (83 runs sampled)
Functional red black tree x 22,012 ops/sec ±4.16% (80 runs sampled)
RB (current) x 112,646 ops/sec ±4.04% (80 runs sampled)
Google Closure library AVL x 25,676 ops/sec ±3.97% (75 runs sampled)
AVL x 78,340 ops/sec ±2.44% (85 runs sampled)
- Fastest is RB (current)
```

Adding google closure library to the benchmark is, of course, unfair, cause the
node.js version of it is not optimised by the compiler, but in this case it
plays the role of straight-forward robust implementation.

## Develop

```shell
npm i
npm t
npm run build
```

## TODO

- [ ] Add option for bubbling elements up as you retrieve them
- [ ] Fix splaying for performance
